    <span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:160%;">Media production</span> and delivery technology may potentially enhance the value of content by formatting,

    given source of content for a specific audience is often found through such electronic reworking of content as
    <b>dynamic and real-time as the trends that fuel its interest.</b>

        now publishing both databases and software to combine content from various sources for a wider variety of audiences.
